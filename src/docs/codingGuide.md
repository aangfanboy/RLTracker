# Coding Practices Guide

This document outlines the coding practices to be followed in this project.

## Naming Conventions for Code

- Use **camelCase** for variables.
    - Example: `blaBla`
- Use underscore for functions
    - Example: `bla_bla`

## Naming Conventions for Config

- Use all capital letters with underscore.
    - Example: `MISSILE_MASS`
- In each definition, also add unit and data type in comment.
    - Example: `MISSILE_MASS = 100.0  # @unit kg, @type float`

## General Guidelines

- All classes should have if name parts in their defining files.

Adhering to these practices will help maintain code readability and quality.
