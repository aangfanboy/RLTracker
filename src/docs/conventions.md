# Conventions and Assumptions for Algorithms

## Quaternions

Hamiltonian convention (X-Y-Z-W) is used.

## Inertial Frame

In single point missile representation stages, inertial frame is the origin of the map, and definitions where [1 0 0] for x is valid. 

## Body Frame

Nose is assumed x-axis, z is down, y completes right hand.
