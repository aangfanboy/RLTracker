# Missile Guidance Project

A simulation project focused on modeling and analyzing missile guidance systems.

## To-Do for Stage 1

- [ ] Create point based EOM for a missile
- [ ] Create stationary target model
- [ ] Implement rotation matrices:
    - [ ] ECI (Earth-Centered Inertial) to NED (North-East-Down)
    - [ ] NED to Body frame
- [ ] Integrate rotation matrices into simulation
- [ ] Add PID controller for missile guidance
- [ ] Simulate missile with PID controller
- [ ] Add RL (Reinforcement Learning) controller for missile guidance
- [ ] Simulate missile with RL controller
- [ ] Compare PID and RL controller performance
