  """Multinomial distribution.

  This Multinomial distribution is parameterized by `probs`, a (batch of)
  length-`K` `prob` (probability) vectors (`K > 1`) such that
  `tf.reduce_sum(probs, -1) = 1`, and a `total_count` number of trials, i.e.,
  the number of trials per draw from the Multinomial. It is defined over a
  (batch of) length-`K` vector `counts` such that
  `tf.reduce_sum(counts, -1) = total_count`. The Multinomial is identically the
  Binomial distribution when `K = 2`.

  #### Mathematical Details

  The Multinomial is a distribution over `K`-class counts, i.e., a length-`K`
  vector of non-negative integer `counts = n = [n_0, ..., n_{K-1}]`.

  The probability mass function (pmf) is,

  ```none
  pmf(n; pi, N) = prod_j (pi_j)**n_j / Z
  Z = (prod_j n_j!) / N!
  ```

  where:
  * `probs = pi = [pi_0, ..., pi_{K-1}]`, `pi_j > 0`, `sum_j pi_j = 1`,
  * `total_count = N`, `N` a positive integer,
  * `Z` is the normalization constant, and,
  * `N!` denotes `N` factorial.

  Distribution parameters are automatically broadcast in all functions; see
  examples for details.

  #### Pitfalls

  The number of classes, `K`, must not exceed:

  - the largest integer representable by `self.dtype`, i.e.,
    `2**(mantissa_bits+1)` (IEE754),
  - the maximum `Tensor` index, i.e., `2**31-1`.

  In other words,

  ```python
  K <= min(2**31-1, {
    tf.float16: 2**11,
    tf.float32: 2**24,
    tf.float64: 2**53 }[param.dtype])
  ```

  Note: This condition is validated only when `self.validate_args = True`.

  #### Examples

  Create a 3-class distribution, with the 3rd class is most likely to be drawn,
  using logits.

  ```python
  logits = [-50., -43, 0]
  dist = Multinomial(total_count=4., logits=logits)
  ```

  Create a 3-class distribution, with the 3rd class is most likely to be drawn.

  ```python
  p = [.2, .3, .5]
  dist = Multinomial(total_count=4., probs=p)
  ```

  The distribution functions can be evaluated on counts.

  ```python
  # counts same shape as p.
  counts = [1., 0, 3]
  dist.prob(counts)  # Shape []

  # p will be broadcast to [[.2, .3, .5], [.2, .3, .5]] to match counts.
  counts = [[1., 2, 1], [2, 2, 0]]
  dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [2]

  # p will be broadcast to shape [5, 7, 3] to match counts.
  counts = [[...]]  # Shape [5, 7, 3]
  dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [5, 7]
  ```

  Create a 2-batch of 3-class distributions.

  ```python
  p = [[.1, .2, .7], [.3, .3, .4]]  # Shape [2, 3]
  dist = Multinomial(total_count=[4., 5], probs=p)

  counts = [[2., 1, 1], [3, 1, 1]]
  dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [2]

  dist.sample(5) # Shape [5, 2, 3]
  ```

    Args:
      total_count: Non-negative floating point tensor with shape broadcastable
        to `[N1,..., Nm]` with `m >= 0`. Defines this as a batch of
        `N1 x ... x Nm` different Multinomial distributions. Its components
        should be equal to integer values.
      logits: Floating point tensor representing unnormalized log-probabilities
        of a positive event with shape broadcastable to
        `[N1,..., Nm, K]` `m >= 0`, and the same dtype as `total_count`. Defines
        this as a batch of `N1 x ... x Nm` different `K` class Multinomial
        distributions. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.
      probs: Positive floating point tensor with shape broadcastable to

        this as a batch of `N1 x ... x Nm` different `K` class Multinomial

        should sum to `1`. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.
      validate_args: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
        parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
        performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect

      allow_nan_stats: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics
        (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the
        result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or
        more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
