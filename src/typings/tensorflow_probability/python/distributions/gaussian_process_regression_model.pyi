  """Posterior predictive distribution in a conjugate GP regression model.

  This class represents the distribution over function values at a set of points
  in some index set, conditioned on noisy observations at some other set of
  points. More specifically, we assume a Gaussian process prior, `f ~ GP(m, k)`
  with IID normal noise on observations of function values. In this model
  posterior inference can be done analytically. This `Distribution` is
  parameterized by

    * the mean and covariance functions of the GP prior,
    * the set of (noisy) observations and index points to which they correspond,
    * the set of index points at which the resulting posterior predictive
      distribution over function values is defined,
    * the observation noise variance,
    * jitter, to compensate for numerical instability of Cholesky decomposition,

  in addition to the usual params like `validate_args` and `allow_nan_stats`.

  #### Mathematical Details

  Gaussian process regression (GPR) assumes a Gaussian process (GP) prior and a
  normal likelihood as a generative model for data. Given GP mean function `m`,
  covariance kernel `k`, and observation noise variance `v`, we have

  ```none
    f ~ GP(m, k)

                     iid
    (y[i] | f, x[i])  ~  Normal(f(x[i]), v),   i = 1, ... , N
  ```

  where `y[i]` are the noisy observations of function values at points `x[i]`.

  In practice, `f` is an infinite object (eg, a function over `R^n`) which can't
  be realized on a finite machine, but fortunately the marginal distribution
  over function values at a finite set of points is just a multivariate normal
  with mean and covariance given by the mean and covariance functions applied at
  our finite set of points (see [Rasmussen and Williams, 2006][1] for a more
  extensive discussion of these facts).

  We spell out the generative model in detail below, but first, a digression on
  notation. In what follows we drop the indices on vectorial objects such as
  `x[i]`, it being implied that we are generally considering finite collections
  of index points and corresponding function values and noisy observations
  thereof. Thus `x` should be considered to stand for a collection of index
  points (indeed, themselves often vectorial). Furthermore:

    * `f(x)` refers to the collection of function values at the index points in
      the collection `x`",
    * `m(t)` refers to the collection of values of the mean function at the
      index points in the collection `t`, and
    * `k(x, t)` refers to the *matrix* whose entries are values of the kernel
      function `k` at all pairs of index points from `x` and `t`.

  With these conventions in place, we may write

  ```none
    (f(x) | x) ~ MVN(m(x), k(x, x))

    (y | f(x), x) ~ Normal(f(x), v)
  ```

  When we condition on observed data `y` at the points `x`, we can derive the
  posterior distribution over function values `f(x)` at those points. We can
  then compute the posterior predictive distribution over function values `f(t)`
  at a new set of points `t`, conditional on those observed data.

  ```none
    (f(t) | t, x, y) ~ MVN(loc, cov)

    where

    loc = m(t) + k(t, x) @ inv(k(x, x) + v * I) @ (y - m(x))
    cov = k(t, t) - k(t, x) @ inv(k(x, x) + v * I) @ k(x, t)
  ```

  where `I` is the identity matrix of appropriate dimension. Finally, the
  distribution over noisy observations at the new set of points `t` is obtained
  by adding IID noise from `Normal(0., observation_noise_variance)`.

  #### Examples

  ##### Draw joint samples from the posterior predictive distribution in a GP
  regression model

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
  import tensorflow_probability as tfp

  tfb = tfp.bijectors
  tfd = tfp.distributions
  psd_kernels = tfp.math.psd_kernels

  # Generate noisy observations from a known function at some random points.
  observation_noise_variance = .5
  f = lambda x: np.sin(10*x[..., 0]) * np.exp(-x[..., 0]**2)
  observation_index_points = np.random.uniform(-1., 1., 50)[..., np.newaxis]
  observations = (f(observation_index_points) +
                  np.random.normal(0., np.sqrt(observation_noise_variance)))

  index_points = np.linspace(-1., 1., 100)[..., np.newaxis]

  kernel = psd_kernels.MaternFiveHalves()

  gprm = tfd.GaussianProcessRegressionModel(
      kernel=kernel,
      index_points=index_points,
      observation_index_points=observation_index_points,
      observations=observations,
      observation_noise_variance=observation_noise_variance)

  samples = gprm.sample(10)
  # ==> 10 independently drawn, joint samples at `index_points`.
  ```

  Above, we have used the kernel with default parameters, which are unlikely to
  be good. Instead, we can train the kernel hyperparameters on the data, as in
  the next example.

  ##### Optimize model parameters via maximum marginal likelihood

  Here we learn the kernel parameters as well as the observation noise variance
  using gradient descent on the maximum marginal likelihood.

  ```python
  # Suppose we have some data from a known function. Note the index points in
  # general have shape `[b1, ..., bB, f1, ..., fF]` (here we assume `F == 1`),
  # so we need to explicitly consume the feature dimensions (just the last one
  # here).
  f = lambda x: np.sin(10*x[..., 0]) * np.exp(-x[..., 0]**2)

  observation_index_points = np.random.uniform(-1., 1., 50)[..., np.newaxis]
  observations = f(observation_index_points) + np.random.normal(0., .05, 50)

  # Define a kernel with trainable parameters. Note we use TransformedVariable
  # to apply a positivity constraint.
  amplitude = tfp.util.TransformedVariable(
    1., tfb.Exp(), dtype=tf.float64, name='amplitude')
  length_scale = tfp.util.TransformedVariable(
    1., tfb.Exp(), dtype=tf.float64, name='length_scale')
  kernel = psd_kernels.ExponentiatedQuadratic(amplitude, length_scale)

  observation_noise_variance = tfp.util.TransformedVariable(
      np.exp(-5), tfb.Exp(), name='observation_noise_variance')

  # We'll use an unconditioned GP to train the kernel parameters.
  gp = tfd.GaussianProcess(
      kernel=kernel,
      index_points=observation_index_points,
      observation_noise_variance=observation_noise_variance)

  optimizer = tf_keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=.05, beta_1=.5, beta_2=.99)

  @tf.function
  def optimize():
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      loss = -gp.log_prob(observations)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, gp.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, gp.trainable_variables))
    return loss

  # We can construct the posterior at a new set of `index_points` using the same
  # kernel (with the same parameters, which we'll optimize below).
  index_points = np.linspace(-1., 1., 100)[..., np.newaxis]
  gprm = tfd.GaussianProcessRegressionModel(
      kernel=kernel,
      index_points=index_points,
      observation_index_points=observation_index_points,
      observations=observations,
      observation_noise_variance=observation_noise_variance)

  # First train the model, then draw and plot posterior samples.
  for i in range(1000):
    neg_log_likelihood_ = optimize()
    if i % 100 == 0:
      print("Step {}: NLL = {}".format(i, neg_log_likelihood_))

  print("Final NLL = {}".format(neg_log_likelihood_))

  samples = gprm.sample(10).numpy()
  # ==> 10 independently drawn, joint samples at `index_points`.

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.scatter(np.squeeze(observation_index_points), observations)
  plt.plot(np.stack([index_points[:, 0]]*10).T, samples.T, c='r', alpha=.2)
  ```

  ##### Marginalization of model hyperparameters

  Here we use TensorFlow Probability's MCMC functionality to perform
  marginalization of the model hyperparameters: kernel params as well as
  observation noise variance.

  ```python
  f = lambda x: np.sin(10*x[..., 0]) * np.exp(-x[..., 0]**2)
  observation_index_points = np.random.uniform(-1., 1., 25)[..., np.newaxis]
  observations = np.random.normal(f(observation_index_points), .05)

    tfd.LogNormal(np.float64(0.), np.float64(1.)),
    lambda noise_variance, length_scale, amplitude: tfd.GaussianProcess(
        kernel=psd_kernels.ExponentiatedQuadratic(amplitude, length_scale),
        index_points=observation_index_points,
        observation_noise_variance=noise_variance)
  ])

  initial_chain_states = [
      1e-1 * tf.ones([], dtype=np.float64, name='init_amplitude'),
      1e-1 * tf.ones([], dtype=np.float64, name='init_length_scale'),
      1e-1 * tf.ones([], dtype=np.float64, name='init_obs_noise_variance')
  ]

  # Since HMC operates over unconstrained space, we need to transform the
  # samples so they live in real-space.

      tfp.bijectors.Softplus(),
      tfp.bijectors.Softplus(),

  print("Acceptance rate: {}".format(np.mean(is_accepted)))

  # Now we can sample from the posterior predictive distribution at a new set
  # of index points.

      mean_fn: Python `callable` that acts on `index_points` to produce a
