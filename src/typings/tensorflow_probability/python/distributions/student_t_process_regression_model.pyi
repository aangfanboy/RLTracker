  This is an analogue of the GaussianProcessRegressionModel, except
  we use a Student-T process here (i.e. this represents the posterior predictive
  of a Student-T process, where we assume that the kernel hyperparameters and
  degrees of freedom are constants, and hence do optimizations in the
  constructor).

  Specifically, we assume a Student-T Process prior, `f ~ StP(df, m, k)` along
  with a noise model whose mathematical implementation is similar to a Gaussian
  Process albeit whose interpretation is very different.

  In particular, this noise model takes the following form:

  ```none
    e ~ MVT(df + n, 0, 1 + v / df * (1 + f^T k(t, t)^-1 f^T))
  ```
  which can be interpreted as Multivariate T noise whose covariance depends on
  the data fit term.

  Using the conventions in the `GaussianProcessRegressionModel` class, we have
  the posterior predictive distribution as:

  ```none
    (f(t) | t, x, f(x)) ~ MVT(df + n, loc, cov)

    where

    n is the number of observation points
    b = (y - loc)^T @ inv(k(x, x) + v * I) @ (y - loc)
    v = observation noise variance
    loc = k(t, x) @ inv(k(x, x) + v * I) @ (y - loc)
    cov = (df + b - 2) / (df + n - 2) * (
      k(t, t) - k(t, x) @ inv(k(x, x) + v * I) @ k(x, t))
  ```

  Note that the posterior predictive mean is the same as a Gaussian Process,
  but the covariance is multiplied by a term that takes in to account
  observations.

  This distribution does precomputaiton in the constructor by assuming
  `observation_index_points`, `observations`, `kernel` and
  `observation_noise_variance` are fixed, and that `mean_fn` is the zero
  function. We do these precomputations in a non-tape safe way.

    Args:

        Must be greather than 2.
      kernel: `PositiveSemidefiniteKernel`-like instance representing the
        StP's covariance function.
      index_points: (Nested) `Tensor` representing finite collection, or batch
        of collections, of points in the index set over which the STP is
        defined. Shape (of each nested component) has the form `[b1, ..., bB,
        e, f1, ..., fF]` where `F` is the number of feature dimensions and
        must equal `kernel.feature_ndims` (or its corresponding nested
        component) and `e` is the number (size) of index points in each
        batch. Ultimately this distribution corresponds to an `e`-dimensional
        multivariate Student T. The batch shape must be broadcastable with
        `kernel.batch_shape` and any batch dims yielded by `mean_fn`.
      observation_index_points: (Nested) `Tensor` representing finite
        collection, or batch of collections, of points in the index set for
        which some data has been observed. Shape (of each nested component)
        has the form `[b1, ..., bB, e, f1, ..., fF]` where `F` is the number
        of feature dimensions and must equal `kernel.feature_ndims` (or its

        index points in each batch. `[b1, ..., bB, e]` must be broadcastable

        broadcastable with the shapes of all other batched parameters
        (`kernel.batch_shape`, `index_points`, etc). The default value is
        `None`, which corresponds to the empty set of observations, and
        simply results in the prior predictive model (a STP with noise of
        variance `predictive_noise_variance`).
      observations: `float` `Tensor` representing collection, or batch of
        collections, of observations corresponding to
        `observation_index_points`. Shape has the form `[b1, ..., bB, e]`, which
        must be brodcastable with the batch and example shapes of

        broadcastable with the shapes of all other batched parameters
        (`kernel.batch_shape`, `index_points`, etc.).
      observation_noise_variance: `float` `Tensor` representing the variance
        of the noise in the Normal likelihood distribution of the model. May be
        batched, in which case the batch shape must be broadcastable with the
        shapes of all other batched parameters (`kernel.batch_shape`,
        `index_points`, etc.).
        Default value: `0.`
      predictive_noise_variance: `float` `Tensor` representing the variance in
        the posterior predictive model. If `None`, we simply re-use
        `observation_noise_variance` for the posterior predictive noise. If set
        explicitly, however, we use this value. This allows us, for example, to
        omit predictive noise variance (by setting this to zero) to obtain
        noiseless posterior predictions of function values, conditioned on noisy
        observations.
      mean_fn: Python `callable` that acts on `index_points` to produce a
        collection, or batch of collections, of mean values at `index_points`.
        Takes a (nested) `Tensor` of shape `[b1, ..., bB, e, f1, ..., fF]` and
        returns a `Tensor` whose shape is broadcastable with `[b1, ..., bB, e]`.
        Default value: `None` implies the constant zero function.
      cholesky_fn: Callable which takes a single (batch) matrix argument and
        returns a Cholesky-like lower triangular factor.  Default value: `None`,
        in which case `make_cholesky_with_jitter_fn`.
      marginal_fn: A Python callable that takes a location, covariance matrix,
        optional `validate_args`, `allow_nan_stats` and `name` arguments, and
        returns a multivariate Student-T subclass of `tfd.Distribution`.
        Default value: `None`, in which case a Cholesky-factorizing function
        is created using `make_cholesky_with_jitter_fn`.
      always_yield_multivariate_student_t: Deprecated and ignored.
      validate_args: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
        parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
        performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
        outputs.
        Default value: `False`.
      allow_nan_stats: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`,
        statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value `NaN` to
        indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised
        if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
        Default value: `False`.

    This differs from the constructor by precomputing quantities associated with
    observations in a non-tape safe way. `index_points` is the only parameter

    initialization).

    Specifically:

    those optimized hyperparameters and observation / index-points pairs.
