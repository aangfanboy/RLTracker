class Beta(distribution.AutoCompositeTensorDistribution):
  """Beta distribution.

  The Beta distribution is defined over the `(0, 1)` interval using parameters
  `concentration1` (aka 'alpha') and `concentration0` (aka 'beta').

  #### Mathematical Details

  The probability density function (pdf) is,

  ```none
  pdf(x; alpha, beta) = x**(alpha - 1) (1 - x)**(beta - 1) / Z
  Z = Gamma(alpha) Gamma(beta) / Gamma(alpha + beta)
  ```

  where:

  * `concentration1 = alpha`,
  * `concentration0 = beta`,
  * `Z` is the normalization constant, and,
  * `Gamma` is the [gamma function](
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function).

  The concentration parameters represent mean total counts of a `1` or a `0`,
  i.e.,

  ```none
  concentration1 = alpha = mean * total_concentration
  concentration0 = beta  = (1. - mean) * total_concentration
  ```

  where `mean` in `(0, 1)` and `total_concentration` is a positive real number
  representing a mean `total_count = concentration1 + concentration0`.

  Distribution parameters are automatically broadcast in all functions; see
  examples for details.

  Warning: The samples can be zero due to finite precision.
  This happens more often when some of the concentrations are very small.
  Make sure to round the samples to `np.finfo(dtype).tiny` before computing the
  density.

  Samples of this distribution are reparameterized (pathwise differentiable).
  The derivatives are computed using the approach described in the paper

  [Michael Figurnov, Shakir Mohamed, Andriy Mnih.
  Implicit Reparameterization Gradients, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08498)

  #### Examples

  ```python
  import tensorflow_probability as tfp
  tfd = tfp.distributions

  # Create a batch of three Beta distributions.
  alpha = [1, 2, 3]
  beta = [1, 2, 3]
  dist = tfd.Beta(alpha, beta)

  dist.sample([4, 5])  # Shape [4, 5, 3]

  # `x` has three batch entries, each with two samples.
  x = [[.1, .4, .5],
       [.2, .3, .5]]
  # Calculate the probability of each pair of samples under the corresponding
  # distribution in `dist`.
  dist.prob(x)         # Shape [2, 3]

  # Define an equivalent Beta distribution parameterized by `mean` and
  # `total_concentration`:
  dist = tfd.Beta.experimental_from_mean_concentration(
    mean=0.5, total_concentration=alpha+beta)
  ```

  ```python
  # Create batch_shape=[2, 3] via parameter broadcast:
  alpha = [[1.], [2]]      # Shape [2, 1]
  beta = [3., 4, 5]        # Shape [3]
  dist = tfd.Beta(alpha, beta)

  # alpha broadcast as: [[1., 1, 1,],
  #                      [2, 2, 2]]
  # beta broadcast as:  [[3., 4, 5],
  #                      [3, 4, 5]]
  # batch_Shape [2, 3]
  dist.sample([4, 5])  # Shape [4, 5, 2, 3]

  x = [.2, .3, .5]
  # x will be broadcast as [[.2, .3, .5],
  #                         [.2, .3, .5]],
  # thus matching batch_shape [2, 3].
  dist.prob(x)         # Shape [2, 3]
  ```

  Compute the gradients of samples w.r.t. the parameters:

  ```python
  alpha = tf.constant(1.0)
  beta = tf.constant(2.0)
  dist = tfd.Beta(alpha, beta)
  samples = dist.sample(5)  # Shape [5]
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(samples))  # Arbitrary loss function
  # Unbiased stochastic gradients of the loss function
  grads = tf.gradients(loss, [alpha, beta])
  ```
