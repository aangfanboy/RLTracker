  """Maps unconstrained R^n to R^n in ascending order.

  Both the domain and the codomain of the mapping is `[-inf, inf]^n`, however,
  the input of the inverse mapping must be strictly increasing.

  On the last dimension of the tensor, the Ascending bijector performs:
  `y = tf.cumsum([x[0], tf.exp(x[1]), tf.exp(x[2]), ..., tf.exp(x[-1])])`

  #### Example Use:

  ```python
  bijectors.Ascending().inverse([2, 3, 4])
  # Result: [2., 0., 0.]

  bijectors.Ascending().forward([0.06428002, -1.07774478, -0.71530371])
  # Result: [0.06428002, 0.40464228, 0.8936858]
