  This can be achieved by an affine transform of the Sigmoid bijector, i.e.,
  it is equivalent to
  ```
  tfb.Chain([tfb.Shift(shift=-1.),
             tfb.Scale(scale=2.),
             tfb.Sigmoid(),
             tfb.Scale(scale=2.)])

  However, using the `Tanh` bijector directly is slightly faster and more
  numerically stable.
