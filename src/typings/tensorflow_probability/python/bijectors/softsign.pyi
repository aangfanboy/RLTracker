  """Bijector which computes `Y = g(X) = X / (1 + |X|)`.

  The softsign `Bijector` has the following two useful properties:

  * The domain is all real numbers
  * `softsign(x) approx sgn(x)`, for large `|x|`.

  #### Examples

  ```python
  # Create the Y = softsign(X) transform.
  softsign = Softsign()
  x = [[[1., 2],
        [3, 4]],
       [[5, 6],
        [7, 8]]]
  x / (1 + abs(x)) == softsign.forward(x)
  x / (1 - abs(x)) == softsign.inverse(x)
  ```
