  Uses Hutchinson's trick to estimate the trace of the Jacobian using automatic
  differentiation. This is the approach used in the original FFJORD paper [1].
  This method computes unreduced trace, as reduction is performed inside of the
  bijector class.

  The trace estimate is obtained by computing
  ```None
  Tr[A] approx_equal sum_{i} r[i]^{T} @ A @ r[i]; r[i] - gaussian sample.
  ```

  For details on the original work see [2].

  Args:
    ode_fn: `Callable(time, state)` that computes time derivative.
    state_shape: `TensorShape` representing the shape of the state.
    dtype: ``tf.DType` object representing the dtype of `state` tensor.
    sample_fn: `Callable(shape, dtype, seed)` that generates random samples with
      zero mean and covariance of an identity matrix.

    num_samples: `Integer` number of random samples to use for trace estimation.
      Default value: '1'
    seed: PRNG seed compatible with `sample_fn`.

  Returns:
    augmented_ode_fn: `Callable(time, (state, log_det_jac))` that computes

class FFJORD(bijector.Bijector):
  """Implements a continuous normalizing flow X->Y defined via an ODE.


  This bijector implements a continuous dynamics transformation
  parameterized by a differential equation, where initial and terminal
  conditions correspond to domain (X) and image (Y) i.e.

  ```None
  d/dt[state(t)]=state_time_derivative_fn(t, state(t))
  state(initial_time) = X
  state(final_time) = Y
  ```

  For this transformation the value of `log_det_jacobian` follows another
  differential equation, reducing it to computation of the trace of the jacbian
  along the trajectory

  ```None
  state_time_derivative = state_time_derivative_fn(t, state(t))
  d/dt[log_det_jac(t)] = Tr(jacobian(state_time_derivative, state(t)))
  ```

  FFJORD constructor takes two functions `ode_solve_fn` and
  `trace_augmentation_fn` arguments that customize integration of the
  differential equation and trace estimation.

  Differential equation integration is performed by a call to `ode_solve_fn`.
  Custom `ode_solve_fn` must accept the following arguments:
  * ode_fn(time, state, **condition_kwargs): Differential equation to be solved.
    Custom `ode_solve_fn`s may optionally support conditional inputs by
    accepting a `constants` dict arg and computing gradients wrt the provided
    values in **condition_kwargs.
  * initial_time: Scalar float or floating Tensor representing the initial time.
  * initial_state: Floating Tensor representing the initial state.
  * solution_times: 1D floating Tensor of solution times.

  And return a Tensor of shape [solution_times.shape, initial_state.shape]
  representing state values evaluated at `solution_times`. In addition
  `ode_solve_fn` must support nested structures. For more details see the
  interface of `tfp.math.ode.Solver.solve()`.

  Trace estimation is computed simultaneously with `state_time_derivative`
  using `augmented_state_time_derivative_fn` that is generated by
  `trace_augmentation_fn`. `trace_augmentation_fn` takes
  `state_time_derivative_fn`, `state.shape` and `state.dtype` arguments and
  returns a `augmented_state_time_derivative_fn` callable that computes both
  `state_time_derivative` and unreduced `trace_estimation`.

  #### Custom `ode_solve_fn` and `trace_augmentation_fn` examples:
  ```python
  # custom_solver_fn: `callable(f, t_initial, t_solutions, y_initial, ...)`
  # custom_solver_kwargs: Additional arguments to pass to custom_solver_fn.
  def ode_solve_fn(ode_fn, initial_time, initial_state, solution_times):
    results = custom_solver_fn(ode_fn, initial_time, solution_times,
                               initial_state, **custom_solver_kwargs)
    return results

  ffjord = tfb.FFJORD(state_time_derivative_fn, ode_solve_fn=ode_solve_fn)
  ```

  ```python
  # state_time_derivative_fn: `callable(time, state)`
  # trace_jac_fn: `callable(time, state)` unreduced jacobian trace function

  def trace_augmentation_fn(ode_fn, state_shape, state_dtype):
    def augmented_ode_fn(time, state):
      return ode_fn(time, state), trace_jac_fn(time, state)
    return augmented_ode_fn

  ffjord = tfb.FFJORD(state_time_derivative_fn,
                      trace_augmentation_fn=trace_augmentation_fn)
  ```

  For more details on FFJORD and continous normalizing flows see [1], [2].

  #### Usage example:
  ```python
  tfd = tfp.distributions
  tfb = tfp.bijectors
  # state_time_derivative_fn: `Callable(time, state)` -> state_time_derivative
  # e.g. Neural network with inputs and outputs of the same shapes and dtypes.

  bijector = tfb.FFJORD(state_time_derivative_fn=state_time_derivative_fn)
  y = bijector.forward(x)  # forward mapping
  x = bijector.inverse(y)  # inverse mapping
  base = tfd.Normal(tf.zeros_like(x), tf.ones_like(x))  # Base distribution
  transformed_distribution = tfd.TransformedDistribution(base, bijector)
