  """State space model for an autoregressive moving average process.

    A state space model (SSM) posits a set of latent (unobserved) variables that
    evolve over time with dynamics specified by a probabilistic transition model
    `p(z[t+1] | z[t])`. At each timestep, we observe a value sampled from an
    observation model conditioned on the current state, `p(x[t] | z[t])`. The
    special case where both the transition and observation models are Gaussians
    with mean specified as a linear function of the inputs, is known as a linear
    Gaussian state space model and supports tractable exact probabilistic
    calculations; see `tfp.distributions.LinearGaussianStateSpaceModel` for
    details.

    In an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process, the expected level at
    each timestep is a linear function of previous levels, with added Gaussian
    noise, and a linear function of previous Gaussian noise:

    ```python
    level[t + 1] = (
      level_drift
      + noise[t + 1]
      + sum(ar_coefficients * levels[t:t-order:-1])
      + sum(ma_coefficients * noise[t:t-order:-1]))
    noise[t + 1] ~ Normal(0., scale=level_scale)
    ```

    The process is characterized by a vector `coefficients` whose size
    determines the order of the process (how many previous values it looks at),
    and by `level_scale`, the standard deviation of the noise added at each
    step.

    This is formulated as a state space model by letting the latent state encode
    the most recent values; see 'Mathematical Details' below.

    The parameters `level_scale` and `observation_noise_scale` are each (a batch
    of) scalars, and `coefficients` is a (batch) vector of size `[order]`. The
    batch shape of this `Distribution` is the broadcast batch
    shape of these parameters and of the `initial_state_prior`.

    #### Mathematical Details

    The Hamilton autoregressive moving average model implements a
    `tfp.distributions.LinearGaussianStateSpaceModel` with `latent_size = order`
    and `observation_size = 1`. The latent state vector encodes the recent
    history of the process, with the current value in the topmost dimension. At
    each timestep, the transition sums the previous values to produce the new
    expected value, shifts all other values down by a dimension, and adds noise
    to the current value. This is formally encoded by the transition model:

    ```
    transition_matrix = [ ar_coefs[0],  ar_coefs[1],    ..., ar_coefs[p]
                          1.,           0,              ..., 0.
                          0.,           1,              ..., 0.
                          ...
                          0.,           0.,  ...,       1.,  0.   ]

    transition_noise ~ N(loc=level_drift / (1. + sum(ma_coefficients)),
                         scale=diag([level_scale, 0., 0., ..., 0.]))
    ```

    The observation model simply extracts the current (topmost) value,
    sums the previous noise and optionally adds independent noise at each step:

    ```
    observation_matrix = [1, ma_coefs[0], ma_coefs[1], ..., ma_coefs[p-1]]
    observation_noise ~ N(loc=0, scale=observation_noise_scale)
    ```

    Models with `observation_noise_scale = 0.` are ARMA(p, p-1) processes
    in the formal sense. Setting `observation_noise_scale` to a nonzero value
    corresponds to a latent ARMA(p, p-1) process observed under an iid noise
    model.
