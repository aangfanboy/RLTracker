def kendalls_tau(y_true, y_pred, name=...):
  """Computes Kendall's Tau for two ordered lists.

  Kendall's Tau measures the correlation between ordinal rankings.
  The provided values may be of any type that is sortable, with the
  argsort indices indicating the true or proposed ordinal sequence.

  Args:
    y_true: a `Tensor` of shape `[n]` containing the true ordinal ranking.
    y_pred: a `Tensor` of shape `[n]` containing the predicted ordering of the
      same N items.
    name: Optional Python `str` name for ops created by this method.
      Default value: `None` (i.e., 'kendalls_tau').

  Returns:
    kendalls_tau: Kendall's Tau, the 1945 tau-b formulation that ignores
      ordering of ties, as a `float32` scalar Tensor.
