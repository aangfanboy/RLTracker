  """Abstract base class for positive semi-definite kernel functions.

  #### Background

  For any set `S`, a real- (or complex-valued) function `k` on the Cartesian
  product `S x S` is called positive semi-definite if we have

  ```none
  sum_i sum_j (c[i]*) c[j] k(x[i], x[j]) >= 0
  ```

  for any finite collections `{x[1], ..., x[N]}` in S and `{c[1], ..., c[N]}` in
  the reals (or the complex plane). '*' denotes the complex conjugate, in the
  complex case.

  Some examples:
    - `S` is R, and `k(s, t) = (s - a) (t - b)`, where a, b are in R. This
      corresponds to a linear kernel.
    - `S` is R^+ U {0}, and `k(s, t) = min(s, t)`. This corresponds to a kernel
      for a Wiener process.
    - `S` is the set of strings over an alphabet `A = {c1, ... cC}`, and
      `k(s, t)` is defined via some similarity metric over strings.

  We model positive semi-definite functions (*kernels*, in common machine
  learning parlance) as classes with 3 primary public methods: `apply`,
  `matrix`, and `tensor`.

  `apply` computes the value of the kernel function at a pair of (batches of)
  input locations. It is the more "low-level" operation: `matrix` and `tensor`
  are implemented in terms of `apply`.

  `matrix` computes the value of the kernel *pairwise* on two (batches of)
  lists of input examples. When the two collections are the same the result is
  called the Gram (or Gramian) matrix
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramian_matrix).

  `tensor` generalizes `matrix`, taking rank `k1` and `k2` collections of
  input examples to a rank `k1 + k2` collection of kernel values.

  #### Kernel Parameter Shape Semantics

  PositiveSemidefiniteKernel implementations support batching of kernel
  parameters and broadcasting of these parameters across batches of inputs. This
  allows, for example, creating a single kernel object which acts like a
  collection of kernels with different parameters. This might be useful for,
  e.g., for exploring multiple random initializations in parallel during a
  kernel parameter optimization procedure.

  The interaction between kernel parameter shapes and input shapes (see below)
  is somewhat subtle. The semantics are designed to make the most common use
  cases easy, while not ruling out more intricate control. The overarching
  principle is that kernel parameter batch shapes must be broadcastable with
  input batch shapes (see below). Examples are provided in the method-level
  documentation.

  #### Input Shape Semantics

  PositiveSemidefiniteKernel methods each support a notion of batching inputs;
  see the method-level documentation for full details; here we describe the
  overall semantics of input shapes. Inputs to PositiveSemidefiniteKernel
  methods partition into 3 pieces:

  ```none
  [b1, ..., bB, e1, ..., eE, f1, ..., fF]
  '----------'  '---------'  '---------'
       |             |            '-- Feature dimensions
       |             '-- Example dimensions
       '-- Batch dimensions
  ```

  - Feature dimensions correspond to the space over which the kernel is defined;
    in typical applications inputs are vectors and this part of the shape is
    rank-1. For example, if our kernel is defined over R^2 x R^2, each input is
    a 2-D vector (a rank-1 tensor of shape `[2,]`) so that
    `F = 1, [f1, ..., fF] = [2]`. If we defined a kernel over DxD matrices, its
    domain would be R^(DxD) x R^(DxD), we would have `F = 2` and
    `[f1, ..., fF] = [D, D]`. Feature shapes of inputs should be the same, but
    no exception will be raised unless they are broadcast-incompatible.
  - Batch dimensions describe collections of inputs which in some sense have
    nothing to do with each other, but may be coupled to batches of kernel
    parameters. It's required that batch dimensions of inputs broadcast with
    each other, and with the kernel's overall batch shape.
  - Example dimensions are shape elements which represent a collection of inputs
    that in some sense "go together" (whereas batches are "independent"). The
    exact semantics are different for the `apply`, `matrix` and `tensor` methods
    (see method-level doc strings for more details). `apply` combines examples
    together pairwise, much like the python built-in `zip`. `matrix` combines
    examples pairwise for *all* pairs of elements from two rank-1 input
    collections (lists), ie, it applies the kernel to all elements in the
    cross-product of two lists of examples. `tensor` further generalizes
    `matrix` to higher rank collections of inputs. Only `matrix` strictly
    requires example dimensions to be present (and to be exactly rank 1),
    although the typical usage of `apply` (eg, building a matrix diagonal) will
    also have `example_ndims` 1.

  Inputs may also be nested structures, in which case the batch and example
  dimensions of all elements must broadcast. The number of feature dimensions of
  each element must be equal to the corresponding element of the `feature_ndims`
  structure.

  ##### Examples

    ```python
    import tensorflow_probability as tfp

    # Suppose `SomeKernel` acts on vectors (rank-1 tensors), ie number of
    # feature dimensions is 1.
    scalar_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(param=.5)
    scalar_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> []

    # `x` and `y` are batches of five 3-D vectors:
    x = np.ones([5, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([5, 3], np.float32)
    scalar_kernel.apply(x, y).shape
    # ==> [5]

    scalar_kernel.matrix(x, y).shape
    # ==> [5, 5]
    ```

    Now we can consider a kernel with batched parameters:

    ```python
    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(param=[.2, .5])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2]

    # `x` and `y` are batches of five 3-D vectors:
    x = np.ones([5, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([5, 3], np.float32)

    batch_kernel.apply(x, y).shape
    # ==> Error! [2] and [5] can't broadcast.
    # We could solve this by telling `apply` to treat the 5 as an example dim:

    batch_kernel.apply(x, y, example_ndims=1).shape
    # ==> [2, 5]

    # Note that example_ndims is implicitly 1 for a call to `matrix`, so the
    # following just works:
    batch_kernel.matrix(x, y).shape
    # ==> [2, 5, 5]
    ```

      `broadcast(Bk, B1, B2) + broadcast(E1, E2)`.

    Given an index set `S`, a kernel function is mathematically defined as a
    real- or complex-valued function on `S` satisfying the
    positive semi-definiteness constraint:

    ```none
    sum_i sum_j (c[i]*) c[j] k(x[i], x[j]) >= 0
    ```

    for any finite collections `{x[1], ..., x[N]}` in `S` and
    `{c[1], ..., c[N]}` in the reals (or the complex plane). '*' is the complex
    conjugate, in the complex case.

    This method most closely resembles the function described in the
    mathematical definition of a kernel. Given a PositiveSemidefiniteKernel `k`
    with scalar parameters and inputs `x` and `y` in `S`, `apply(x, y)` yields a
    single scalar value.

    #### Examples

    ```python
    import tensorflow_probability as tfp

    # Suppose `SomeKernel` acts on vectors (rank-1 tensors)
    scalar_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(param=.5)
    scalar_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> []

    # `x` and `y` are batches of five 3-D vectors:
    x = np.ones([5, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([5, 3], np.float32)
    scalar_kernel.apply(x, y).shape
    # ==> [5]
    ```

    The above output is the result of vectorized computation of the five values

    ```none
    [k(x[0], y[0]), k(x[1], y[1]), ..., k(x[4], y[4])]
    ```

    Now we can consider a kernel with batched parameters:

    ```python
    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(param=[.2, .5])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2]
    batch_kernel.apply(x, y).shape
    # ==> Error! [2] and [5] can't broadcast.
    ```

    The parameter batch shape of `[2]` and the input batch shape of `[5]` can't
    be broadcast together. We can fix this in either of two ways:

    ##### Fix #1
    Give the parameter a shape of `[2, 1]` which will correctly broadcast with
    `[5]` to yield `[2, 5]`:

    ```python
    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(
        param=[[.2], [.5]])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2, 1]
    batch_kernel.apply(x, y).shape
    # ==> [2, 5]
    ```

    ##### Fix #2
    By specifying `example_ndims`, which tells the kernel to treat the `5` in
    the input shape as part of the "example shape", and "pushing" the kernel
    batch shape to the left:

    ```python
    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(param=[.2, .5])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2]
    batch_kernel.apply(x, y, example_ndims=1).shape

      `broadcast(Bk, B1, B2) + [e1, e2]` (note this differs from `apply`: the

      are broadcast together).

    ```

    This method computes the batch of `e1 x e2` matrices resulting from applying
    the kernel function to all pairs of inputs from `x1` and `x2`. The shape
    of the batch of matrices is the result of broadcasting the batch shapes of
    `x1`, `x2`, and the kernel parameters (see examples below). As such, it's
    required that these shapes all be broadcast compatible. However, the kernel
    parameter batch shapes need not broadcast against the 'example shapes' (`e1`
    and `e2` above).

    When the two inputs are the (batches of) identical collections, the
    resulting matrix is the so-called Gram (or Gramian) matrix
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramian_matrix).

    #### Examples

    First, consider a kernel with a single scalar parameter.

    ```python
    import tensorflow_probability as tfp

    scalar_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(param=.5)
    scalar_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> []

    # Our inputs are two lists of 3-D vectors
    x = np.ones([5, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([4, 3], np.float32)
    scalar_kernel.matrix(x, y).shape
    # ==> [5, 4]
    ```

    The result comes from applying the kernel to the entries in `x` and `y`
    pairwise, across all pairs:

      ```none
      | k(x[0], y[0])    k(x[0], y[1])  ...  k(x[0], y[3]) |
      | k(x[1], y[0])    k(x[1], y[1])  ...  k(x[1], y[3]) |
      |      ...              ...                 ...      |
      | k(x[4], y[0])    k(x[4], y[1])  ...  k(x[4], y[3]) |
      ```

    Now consider a kernel with batched parameters with the same inputs

    ```python
    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(param=[1., .5])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2]

    batch_kernel.matrix(x, y).shape
    # ==> [2, 5, 4]
    ```

    This results in a batch of 2 matrices, one computed from the kernel with
    `param = 1.` and the other with `param = .5`.

    We also support batching of the inputs. First, let's look at that with
    the scalar kernel again.

    ```python
    # Batch of 10 lists of 5 vectors of dimension 3
    x = np.ones([10, 5, 3], np.float32)

    # Batch of 10 lists of 4 vectors of dimension 3
    y = np.ones([10, 4, 3], np.float32)

    scalar_kernel.matrix(x, y).shape
    # ==> [10, 5, 4]
    ```

    The result is a batch of 10 matrices built from the batch of 10 lists of
    input vectors. These batch shapes have to be broadcastable. The following
    will *not* work:

    ```python
    x = np.ones([10, 5, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([20, 4, 3], np.float32)
    scalar_kernel.matrix(x, y).shape
    # ==> Error! [10] and [20] can't broadcast.
    ```

    Now let's consider batches of inputs in conjunction with batches of kernel
    parameters. We require that the input batch shapes be broadcastable with
    the kernel parameter batch shapes, otherwise we get an error:

    ```python
    x = np.ones([10, 5, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([10, 4, 3], np.float32)

    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(params=[1., .5])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2]
    batch_kernel.matrix(x, y).shape
    # ==> Error! [2] and [10] can't broadcast.
    ```

    The fix is to make the kernel parameter shape broadcastable with `[10]` (or
    reshape the inputs to be broadcastable!):

    ```python
    x = np.ones([10, 5, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([10, 4, 3], np.float32)

    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(
        params=[[1.], [.5]])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2, 1]
    batch_kernel.matrix(x, y).shape
    # ==> [2, 10, 5, 4]

    # Or, make the inputs broadcastable:
    x = np.ones([10, 1, 5, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([10, 1, 4, 3], np.float32)

    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(

    Returns:
      `Tensor` containing (possibly batched) kernel applications to pairs from
      inputs `x1` and `x2`. If the kernel parameters' batch shape is `Bk` then
      the shape of the `Tensor` resulting from this method call is
      `broadcast(Bk, B1, B2) + E1 + E2`. Note this differs from `apply`: the
      example dimensions are concatenated, whereas in `apply` the example dims
      are broadcast together. It also differs from `matrix`: the example shapes
      are arbitrary here, and the result accrues a rank equal to the sum of the
      ranks of the input example shapes.

    #### Examples

    First, consider a kernel with a single scalar parameter.

    ```python
    import tensorflow_probability as tfp

    scalar_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(param=.5)
    scalar_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> []

    # Our inputs are two rank-2 collections of 3-D vectors
    x = np.ones([5, 6, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([7, 8, 3], np.float32)
    scalar_kernel.tensor(x, y, x1_example_ndims=2, x2_example_ndims=2).shape
    # ==> [5, 6, 7, 8]

    # Empty example shapes work too!
    x = np.ones([3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([5, 3], np.float32)
    scalar_kernel.tensor(x, y, x1_example_ndims=0, x2_example_ndims=1).shape
    # ==> [5]
    ```

    The result comes from applying the kernel to the entries in `x` and `y`
    pairwise, across all pairs:

      ```none
      | k(x[0], y[0])    k(x[0], y[1])  ...  k(x[0], y[3]) |
      | k(x[1], y[0])    k(x[1], y[1])  ...  k(x[1], y[3]) |
      |      ...              ...                 ...      |
      | k(x[4], y[0])    k(x[4], y[1])  ...  k(x[4], y[3]) |
      ```

    Now consider a kernel with batched parameters.

    ```python
    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(param=[1., .5])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2]

    # Inputs are two rank-2 collections of 3-D vectors
    x = np.ones([5, 6, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([7, 8, 3], np.float32)
    scalar_kernel.tensor(x, y, x1_example_ndims=2, x2_example_ndims=2).shape
    # ==> [2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    ```

    We also support batching of the inputs. First, let's look at that with
    the scalar kernel again.

    ```python
    # Batch of 10 lists of 5x6 collections of dimension 3
    x = np.ones([10, 5, 6, 3], np.float32)

    # Batch of 10 lists of 7x8 collections of dimension 3
    y = np.ones([10, 7, 8, 3], np.float32)

    scalar_kernel.tensor(x, y, x1_example_ndims=2, x2_example_ndims=2).shape
    # ==> [10, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    ```

    The result is a batch of 10 tensors built from the batch of 10 rank-2
    collections of input vectors. The batch shapes have to be broadcastable.
    The following will *not* work:

    ```python
    x = np.ones([10, 5, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([20, 4, 3], np.float32)
    scalar_kernel.tensor(x, y, x1_example_ndims=1, x2_example_ndims=1).shape
    # ==> Error! [10] and [20] can't broadcast.
    ```

    Now let's consider batches of inputs in conjunction with batches of kernel
    parameters. We require that the input batch shapes be broadcastable with
    the kernel parameter batch shapes, otherwise we get an error:

    ```python
    x = np.ones([10, 5, 6, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([10, 7, 8, 3], np.float32)

    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(params=[1., .5])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2]
    batch_kernel.tensor(x, y, x1_example_ndims=2, x2_example_ndims=2).shape
    # ==> Error! [2] and [10] can't broadcast.
    ```

    The fix is to make the kernel parameter shape broadcastable with `[10]` (or
    reshape the inputs to be broadcastable!):

    ```python
    x = np.ones([10, 5, 6, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([10, 7, 8, 3], np.float32)

    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(
        params=[[1.], [.5]])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2, 1]
    batch_kernel.tensor(x, y, x1_example_ndims=2, x2_example_ndims=2).shape
    # ==> [2, 10, 5, 6, 7, 8]

    # Or, make the inputs broadcastable:
    x = np.ones([10, 1, 5, 6, 3], np.float32)
    y = np.ones([10, 1, 7, 8, 3], np.float32)

    batch_kernel = tfp.math.psd_kernels.SomeKernel(
        params=[1., .5])
    batch_kernel.batch_shape
    # ==> [2]
    batch_kernel.tensor(x, y, x1_example_ndims=2, x2_example_ndims=2).shape
    # ==> [10, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    ```
