  This kernel is defined as over positive real numbers as:

  ```none
  k(x, y) = int_0^inf exp(-s * x) exp(-s * y) GammaPDF(c, r)
  ```
  where:
    * `GammaPDF` is the pdf of the Gamma distribution.
    * `c` is the concentration parameter of the Gamma distribution.
    * `r` is the rate parameter of the Gamma distribution.

  See equation 6 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3896.pdf

  When parameterizing a 1-dimensional Gaussian Process, this kernel produces
  samples that strongly favor exponential functions.

  When called on multiple feature dimensions, all feature dimensions are added
  together before the kernel function is applied.
