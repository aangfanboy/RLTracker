  `TensorShape` as the return value, it is possible to represent
  unknown dimensions; by contrast, `constant_value()` is

  This method can be called multiple times, and will merge the given

  provide additional information about the shape of this tensor that
  cannot be inferred from the graph alone. For example, this can be used
  to provide additional information about the shapes of images:

  ```python
  _, image_data = tf.TFRecordReader(...).read(...)
  image = tf.image.decode_png(image_data, channels=3)

  # The height and width dimensions of `image` are data dependent, and
  # cannot be computed without executing the op.

  NOTE: This shape is not enforced at runtime. Setting incorrect shapes can
  result in inconsistencies between the statically-known graph and the runtime
  value of tensors. For runtime validation of the shape, use `tf.ensure_shape`
  instead.
