  """A distribution representing an unnormalized measure on a singleton set.

  `IncrementLogProb` represents a "factor", which can also be thought of as a
  measure of the given size on a sample space consisting of a single element.
  Its raison d'Ãªtre is to provide a computed offset to the log probability of a
  `JointDistribution`.  A `JointDistribution` containing an `IncrementLogProb`
  still represents a measure, but that measure is no longer in general a
  probability measure (i.e., the probability may no longer integrate to 1).

  Even though sampling from any measure represented by
  `IncrementLogProb` is information-free, `IncrementLogProb` retains a
  `sample` method for API compatibility with other Distributions.
  This `sample` method returns a (batch) shape-[0] Tensor with the
  same `dtype` as the `log_prob_increment` argument provided
  originally.
