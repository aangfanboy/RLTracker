"""Compute einsums in log space."""
def logeinsumexp(formula, *tensors):
  """Computing `einsum` in logarithmic space.

  Args:
    formula: a formula compatible with `einsum`. (But note that
      ellipses are not supported.)
    *tensors: tensors to which contractions will be applied.

  Returns:
    `logeinsumexp(formula, *tensors)` is equivalent to
    `tf.math.log(einsum(formula, *map(tf.math.exp, tensors)))` except
    that it is more numerically stable.

  Notes:
    This implementation of `logeinsumexp` is primarily intended for internal
    use in the `marginalize` library and assumes the formula is well-formed.
