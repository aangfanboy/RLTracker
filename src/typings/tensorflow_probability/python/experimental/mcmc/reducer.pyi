class Reducer:
  """Base class for all MCMC `Reducer`s.

  This class defines the minimal requirements to implement a Markov chain Monte
  Carlo (MCMC) reducer. A reducer updates a streaming computation by reducing
  new samples to a summary statistic. `Reducer`s can be defined to return "side
  information" if desired, but they do not remember state. Hence, reducers
  should be seen as objects that hold metadata (i.e. shape and dtype of
  incoming samples) and all reducer method calls must be coupled with a state
  object, as first returned by the `initialize` method.
